  <!--  interval: How long a single bounce takes.
        min-speed-offset: The speed of the ball is calculated
                    by adding the speed-offset to the difficulty's
                    max-speed. min-speed-offset is used when the
                    ball is closer than min-offset-distance
                    to the target.
        max-speed-offset: The additional speed of the ball when
                    farther than max-offset-distance.
        speed : defines the initial speed. Mainly kept for
                    compatibility with flyable class
        min-offset-distance: The distance under which the ball is
                    at minimal speed.
        max-offset-distance: The distance over which the ball is
                    at maximal speed. If it is not equal to
                    min-offset-distance, the ball speeds between
                    both is a weighted average of the min and
                    max speed.
        max-height: The maximum height of a bounce.
        min-height: Unused mostly, but defines implicitly
                    the starting height (as average of
                    max and min height).
        fast-ping-distance: When the ball is closer than 
                    this to the target, it will bounce
                    low and at a high rate.
        target-distance: When the ball is closer than 
                    this to the target, it will aim
                    directly at the target.
        target-max-angle: Once the ball is aiming for its
                    target, it can at most change the angle
                    this much per second(!).
        min-interpolation-distance: how far the control
                    points (which are center of squads)
                    must be from each other. A large value
                    allows smoother turning (no abrupt
                    change of direction), but a large
                    value can result in the ball being
                    off track (e.g. a value of 30 results
                    on the ramp in sand track that the 
                    ball goes to the left of the tunnel,
                    bouncing on the pyramid). Quite
                    catastrophal on the startrack and
                    skyline).
        squash-slowdown: How much karts that are 
                    squashed are slowed down.
        squash-duration: How long karts stay squashed.
        delete-timer: How long before the ball is removed
                    if no suitable target is found.
        early-target-factor: the rubber ball can use the
                    relative position of the kart to the
                    center of the track for improved targeting
                    (i.e. the ball will align its relative
                    position to the center of the track early).
                    This allows a lower target-distance to be
                    used since the ball is better aligned,
                    hopefully reducing the frequency of 
                    tunneling.
